Abstract

False or inaccurate information that circulates
social media platforms can instill false beliefs
and encourage ill-informed decisions. This can
have adverse effects on the society as a whole,
especially during the pandemic period. Thus,
it is imperative to utilize the latest techniques
in Artificial Intelligence and Analytics to curb
the spread of misinformation. I employ a
sequential deep learning network with Word
Embeddings-based feature extraction to detect
false and inaccurate social media content such
as Facebook posts and Tweets. My hybrid
architecture leverages the strength of Convolutional
Neural Nets (CNNs) at feature learning
and the insensitivity to gap length of Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. I train
my model on a COVID-19 social media data
set to learn the semantic structures within
various lengths of Tweets or other texts on
social media for high-performance detection
of fake news. My tuned model yields a test
accuracy of 86.88% and a True Positive rate
of 88.76%. Further refinement to the hybrid
architecture and parameter tuning should yield
higher performance closer to that required of a
real-time fake news detector.
